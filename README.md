# Bridge
## Goal
With **Bridge** we aim to bridge the gap between help and those in need.

## What it does
**Bridge** connects specially-abled users to volunteers on demand based on multiple features like location, age, and specific disabilities that the volunteer can support. The platform then helps them connect with each other. In the near future, the project will include features to join community activities, provide employment opportunities and much more!

## How we built it
We built the first iteration of **Bridge** using Python with the Telegram API for the frontend. This enables ease of access for those that are not familiar with technology which is a key consideration for the target audience. The Bridge database runs on Google Cloud Firestore since this NoSQL option is the most flexible and provides great developer experience.
